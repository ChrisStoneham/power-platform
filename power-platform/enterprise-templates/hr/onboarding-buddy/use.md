# Get started using the Onboarding Buddy app

Three kinds of employees interact with the Onboarding Buddy app as part of Your organization's onboarding program for new hires and transfers:

- **Buddies** use the app to sign up as a Buddy.
- **Managers** use the app to match Buddies with Onboarders.
- **Onboarders**, or new employees, don't use the app directly, but they're matched with an onboarding Buddy in the app.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two admin roles that may also directly use the Onboarding Buddy app even though their primary functions are to configure and manage the app.
>
> - **Power Platform admin**. As a Power Platform admin, you install and configure the Onboarding Buddy Admin app for the Program admin and the Onboarding Buddy app for users.
> - **Program admin**. As a Program admin, you manage the Onboarding Buddy program through the Onboarding Buddy Admin app.
