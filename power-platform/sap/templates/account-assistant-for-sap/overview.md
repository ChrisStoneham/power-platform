# Account assistant for SAP&reg; solutions

The Account assistant for SAP&reg; solutions is an advanced, LLM-based assistant that translates business-oriented goals into actionable SAP NetWeaver tasks.

It helps makers discover what specific SAP BAPIs, RFCs, and table reads are needed to achieve their business goals by empowering makers to build tools to retrieve information and execute operations quickly and easily.

The combination of AI and the ability to directly interact with your SAP system allows for easy discoverability and rapid iteration and experimentation. Designed for makers and organizations integrating SAP with Power Platform, this tool provides dynamic, installation-specific insights to maximize accuracy when working to integrate Power Platform with your specific SAP system.

## Not for Production Use

> [!WARNING]
> This agent has wide latitude when interacting with SAP systems. It is intended to be used only in a development environment.

## Create connections with a read-only user

It is recommended that you connect to SAP using a read-only user designed for the purpose. It is important that the agent have the ability to read everything in your SAP system, but it could be dangerous to allow it to write data. Remote function calls provided by SAP can be very powerful, and the agent may make changes that are unintended if allowed to do so.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Account assistant for SAP&reg; solutions, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:

- Microsoft Copilot Studio licenses for your makers.
- Microsoft Copilot Studio message capacity *or* pay-as-you-go plan.
- [Microsoft Power Platform and SAP integration](/power-platform/sap/connect/connect-power-platform-and-sap)

## Use Cases

The Account assistant for SAPÂ® is an essential tool for both employees and support agents. Employees can resolve account access issues independently, avoiding delays and ensuring uninterrupted workflow. Support teams benefit from reduced workloads as routine tasks, like account unlocks, are handled directly by users. This solution is particularly valuable for organizations looking to minimize downtime, improve user satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation in account servicing scenarios.
