# Manage Copilot Studio messages and capacity 

The Copilot Studio capacity management experience in the Power Platform Admin Center enables administrators to manage Copilot Studio message and session capacity while monitoring overall capacity consumption. This interface also provides an overview of the licensing models in use.

Capacity management features allow administrators to allocate pre-purchased capacity across environments within the tenant based on anticipated usage of Copilot agents in each environment. The capacity management panel includes daily consumption data at the environment level for up to three months, helping to determine appropriate capacity needs.

The consumption monitoring views in capacity management provide detailed, daily usage data for the current month-to-date, the last two full months, and monthly data for the past 12 months, supporting budgeting and licensing planning.

The licensing summary view shows usage of both pre-paid and session-based capacity units.
Purchasing a Microsoft Copilot Studio license includes a specified number of billed message units pooled across the tenant, which must be assigned to an environment to enable Microsoft Copilot Studio features for agents in that environment.

# Pay-As-You-Go Messages Card:
This card displays the count of active billing plans with Copilot Studio meter enabled, along with the month-to-date total of Copilot Studio message units billed to these plans.

# Pre-paid Capacity Card:
The Pre-paid Capacity card shows the number of pre-paid capacity units that have been purchased, assigned, and consumed. These units can be either session-based or message capacity units, with a link provided to manage each type.

It also indicates the environment's status, such as whether it's within capacity or in overage, if capacity is allocated, and if Pay-As-You-Go is enabled.
