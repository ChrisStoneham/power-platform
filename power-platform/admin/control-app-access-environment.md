# Control which apps are allowed in your environment (preview)

[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

You can protect against data exfiltration by managing and controlling what apps can run in your Dataverse environment. Data exfiltration safeguards help prevent sensitive information from unauthorized removal or extraction from your environment. This allows a business to maintain business continuity and comply with regulatory requirements.

You can configure which apps are allowed or blocked in your environment. Malicious users canâ€™t create or use unapproved apps to export sensitive data out of the environment.
