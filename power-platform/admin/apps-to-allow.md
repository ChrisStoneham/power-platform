[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The following apps are Microsoft first-party services. These apps cannot be blocked using this feature since you can manage your user's usage of these apps by either assigning the appropriate user license or assigning the respective Dataverse security role, for example to use the [Powerapps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/environments), your maker must be assigned with either a Environment Maker, System Customizer, or System Administrator security role.
